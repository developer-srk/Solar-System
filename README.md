# Solar-System

Description: This project is a simple representation of a small part of the Solar System, featuring the Earth, its Moon, and Mars, all orbiting around the Sun. Created using only HTML, this visual displays the basic idea of how planets and moons move in space, with Earth and Mars revolving around the Sun, while the Moon orbits the Earth.

Features:

Earth, Moon, and Mars: The Earth, Moon, and Mars are placed in their approximate positions relative to each other.
Simple Movement Representation: Earth and Mars orbit around the Sun, and the Moon orbits around Earth.
Static Display: While the layout is static, it visually demonstrates how the Earth and Mars move in their orbits, and the Moon orbits the Earth.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Used to structure the Solar System and position the Sun, Earth, Moon, and Mars.
Future Ideas:

Adding CSS or JavaScript to animate the orbits, showing the actual movement of the Earth, Moon, and Mars around the Sun.
Adding more planets or moons for a fuller Solar System model.
Making the orbits dynamic with the ability to zoom in and out or add more interactive features.
